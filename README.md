# Zachary Bryce Ellis

Hello, my name is Bryce! üëãüèø I'm an iOS developer in Memphis with a B.S. in Computer Science. üìç I've used Xcode and Swift since 2017 kicking off my career passion for mobile app development. Running marathons became my next passion, and after completing a 50 mile race, I built an Apple Watch app that transforms complex health data into an user-friendly [Stamina Bar].




# Languages and Tools:
![Swift](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-FA7343?style=for-the-badge&logo=swift&logoColor=white) ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-FFD43B?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=blue) ![CocoaPods](https://img.shields.io/badge/cocoapods-FA2A02?style=for-the-badge&logo=cocoapods&logoColor=white) ![Xcode](https://img.shields.io/badge/Xcode-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=Xcode&logoColor=white) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/App_Store-0D96F6?style=for-the-badge&logo=app-store&logoColor=white" /> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/firebase-ffca28?style=for-the-badge&logo=firebase&logoColor=black" />

- I am strongest in the Swift programming language and familiar with Apple SDKs including but not limited to: UIKit, SwiftUI, HealthKit, ARKit, MapKit, CoreData, CocaPods, RxSwift, Combine, and Firebase. I have a very strong understanding of Xcode including but not limited to Source Control, Automated testing using XCTest, and using Instruments debugging Network Activity and API call performance. I have a very strong understanding App Store deployment processes as in my professional experience I successfully manage the updates over 100 apps on the public App Store and Apple Business Manager.

- Initially, design seemed like a daunting skill to learn in iOS Development, but it has become an art that I truly appreciate. When building my own app, I had to design an app icon and all the UI elements. Additionally, I recognized the importance of prototyping. Being able to visualize what an app should look like or interact with a new feature before investing development time has become a strategy I employ, inspired this [WWDC session](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2014/223/).

# Agile:

- The [Agile Manifesto](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/) serves as the ultimate guideline to follow. For me, Agile is about effectively managing a software project. It involves a team that is committed to a shared mission, works collaboratively, communicates honestly and constructively, and ultimately builds software that solves real-world problems.
