# Zachary Bryce Ellis

Hello, my name is Bryce! üëãüèø I'm an iOS developer based in Memphis, TN, holding a B.S. in Computer Science. üìç Since 2017, I've been using Xcode and Swift, fueling my passion for mobile app development. My interest in running marathons, culminating in completing a 50-mile race, inspired me to create an Apple Watch app. This app simplifies complex health data into a user-friendly feature I call the [Stamina Bar].

- I am an Xcode power user, well-versed in App Store deployment, and my strongest skills lie in Swift programming language, particularly with iOS SDKs such as UIKit, SwiftUI, and HealthKit
